# Guitar Fretboard Trainer

With this program, you can train your knowledge of the notes on the guitar fretboard.

## Description

This is a project I made mainly for my own use. I myself play guitar and want to internalize the notes on the guitar fretboard better to improve my playing.
So I made this program, where you can train your speed at recognizing the correct spot on the fretboard for a given string.
Here is how it works:
You can choose between a "Classic"-mode, which is more gamified, and a "Practice"-mode.

### Classic Mode
An image of a guitar fretboard gets shown and a timer starts from the 3:00 minute mark. A random string and a random note will get shown and you have to select the correct spot on the fretboard.
If you select the correct spot, you receive a point and another string and note will appear for you to select.
Should you select a wrong spot, the 5 seconds are deducted from the timer.
When the timer reaches 0:00, you will see your final score and your highscore.

### Practice Mode
The general functionality is similar to the classic mode, but there is no time pressure or score. This mode runs as long as you want, until you exit to the menu using the button in the corner.
Additionaly, you can select a single string or a small set of strings to practice, if you want to focus on specific ones.

### Important information about the fretboard
* The borders of the imagemap are exactly at the fretlines, so select the string between two fretlines for it to work correctly
* For the open strings (for example note "E" on the E-string), do not select the neck at the left side, but the 12th on the right
